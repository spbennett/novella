Novella is intended to be a new open-source eBook management application written on top of NodeJS powered by Web Technologies.

This began as a personal project of mine as a chance to learn more about MVC using Javascript.  I also wanted to develop a modern desktop application from end-to-end with some fun new tools.

eBook Library applications exist, but each has its own problems.  Mac has iBooks but it's not Kindle friendly.  Calibre is feature-rich but the UI is a horror on the eyes.  

I finally spent a few weekends mapping out what I'd like in an eBook manager and I scraped together some initial code for a prototype.

I am now releasing what I've made to make it available to the open-source and Github communities.

So here we are.
