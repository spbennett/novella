# Novella (WIP)
Introducing Novella

Novella is a new open-source eBook management application written on top of NodeJS powered by Web Technologies.

This began as a personal project of mine as a chance to learn more about MVC using Javascript.  I also wanted to develop a modern desktop application from end-to-end with some fun new tools.

I haven't found any eBook applications that I really like out there.  Mac has iBooks but it's not Kindle friendly.  There's Calibre but the user interface is a horror on the eyes.  Finally, I spent a few weekends mapping out what I'd like in an eBook manager and I scraped together some initial code for a prototype.

I am now releasing what I've made to make it available to the open-source and Github communities.

So here we are.
