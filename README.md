Novella will be a new open-source eBook management application powered by Web Technologies.  It is written in [Dart by Google](https://www.dartlang.org) and powered by [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org) web components.

To me, this project is a chance to learn more about MVC using modern web development tools and frameworks.  I also thought the world would be a better place with a modern, modular open-source eBook manager written in web languages that anyone can contribute to.

There are other great eBook Library applications out there, but each has its own problems.  Mac has iBooks but it's close-source and not Kindle friendly.  Calibre is feature-rich but the UI is a horror on the eyes.  

Finally, I decided to do something about it and spent a few weekends mapping out what I'd like in an eBook manager.  What you see is the code I scraped together for a prototype.

This project is available to the open-source and Github communities.  Feel free to fork it and submit a pull request.  Also, feedback on where you'd like to see the project go is welcome.
